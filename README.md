This portfolio contains different projects I have completed during my time in school. 
- LogisticRegression-RandomForest is a project I completed in an applied statistics course that allowed us to practice using the programming language R to complete logistic regression analysis. This particular project
  was for researching risk factors for heart disease which would then allow for the prediction of whether or not a person is at risk for heart disease.

- DAT430 Project Two is a project with a focus on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). This EDA process was to allow for greater insight into a dataset containing information that may be helpful in identifying causes of
  attrition within the company. Discovering the main cause for potentially high attrition rates would allow the company to address the issue by discover solutions based on the insights provided in the analysis.

- Uber_EDA is a project I did outside of school using a dataset found on Kaggle. I wanted to practice my skills so that I would not lose them. This file I have begun to clean the dataset, removing duplicates,
  addressing null values, and ensuring consistent formatting. I also used this as an opportunity to begin creating reusable functions that can be applied to other projects with little adjustments needed.

- AddressingDefectsPresentation is part of a project I completed in one of my final terms at SNHU. We were tasked with assessing an increase in defects across three different models of electronic boards. This was done   with the use of Pareto charts and ANOVA testing. One downfall is that we were given different datasets, the first datasets used for the Pareto charts gave us the actual model numbers, while the next datasets gave us   descriptions such as Model 1, Model 2, Model 3. This made it virtually impossible to tie together the findings of the Pareto charts with the findings of the ANOVA tests without worry of creating inaccurate results.
